**[Jan 06, 2019] Start of work. Under construction.**  

# Introduction
This repository was created inspired by **[Image abnormality detection using deep learning ーPapers and implementationー - Qiita - shinmura0](https://qiita.com/shinmura0/items/cfb51f66b2d172f2403b)**.  
I would like to express my deepest gratitude for having pleasantly accepted his skill, consideration and article quotation.  
His articles that were supposed to be used practically, not limited to logic alone, are wonderful.  
However, I don't have the skills to read papers, nor do I have skills to read mathematical expressions.  
I only want to verify the effectiveness of his wonderful article content in a practical range.  

# Translating shinmura0's article
## 1. Introduction
There are many methods such as methods using **"[Implemented ALOCC for detecting anomalies by deep learning (GAN) - Qiia - kzkadc](https://qiita.com/kzkadc/items/334c3d85c2acab38f105)"** and methods using **"[Detection of Video Anomalies Using Convolutional Autoencoders and One-Class Support Vector Machines (AutoEncoder)](http://cbic2017.org/papers/cbic-paper-49.pdf)"** for image anomaly detection using deep learning.  
Here is an article on detecting abnormality of images using "Variational Autoencoder".  
**[Image abnormality detection using Variational Autoencoder (Variational Autoencoder) - Qiita - shinmura0](https://qiita.com/shinmura0/items/811d01384e20bfd1e035)**  

The method to be introduced this time is to detect abnormality by devising the loss function using normal convolution neural network(CNN).

In conclusion, it was found that **this method has good anomaly detection accuracy** and visualization of abnormal spots is also possible.  

## 2. Overview
This paper states that it achieved state-of-the-art at the time of publication.  
In the figure below, we learned under various conditions using normal CNN and visualized the output from the convolution layer with t-SNE.

- Figure (b): Alexnet's learned model with Normal and Abnormal distributed
- Figure (c): Diagram learned with Normal vs Abnormal
- Figure (e): Proposed method (DOC)

I think that it is not only me that thinking that abnormality can be detected also in figure (b).  
However, it is somewhat inferior to figure (e).  
  
In the thesis, it finally uses "k neighborhood method" in (e) to detect abnormality.  
As a learning method, view the images that you want to detect abnormality at the same time, completely different kinds of images, and narrow down the range of the images for which you want to detect anomalies.
